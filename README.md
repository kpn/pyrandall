# PYRANDALL

Data simulation and validation framework that supports Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD)<sup>1</sup>. \
Pyrandall' focus is to drive the development of streaming architectures and Event Sourcing<sup>2</sup>.

## Running examples

```
# setup a venv and start mocks to
docker-compose up -d
pip install flask
python stubserver.py
```

```
# Simulate events from examples/scenarios/v2.yaml and files found in examples/events
./examples/pyrandall simulate v2.yaml
```

```
# Validate results from examples/scenarios/v2.yaml and files found in examples/results
./examples/pyrandall validate v2.yaml
```

# Example of scenario/v2 schema

The input yaml is validated with jsonschema, the schema can be found here [pyrandall/schemas/scenario/v2.yaml](https://github.com/kpn/pyrandall/tree/master/pyrandall/schemas/scenario/v2.yaml).

```

    - description: HTTP to an ingest API and key-value API
      simulate:
        adapter: requests/http
        requests:
          - path: /v1/actions/produce-event

              status_code: { equals_to: 200 }
              body: { equals_to_event: expected_result.json }
    - description: Produce and Consumer to kafka
      simulate:
        adapter: broker/kafka
        messages:
          - topic: emails
            events:
              - email1.json

            assert_that_received:
              timeout_after: "5m"
              total_events: { equals_to: 4 } # I observed in total 4 events
              unordered:
                - { equals_to_event: word_count.json }
          - topic: email_results
            assert_that_received:
              last_event: { equals_to_event: word_count.json }
              timeout_after: 5m
```


## Features and Ideas

* Runnable pyrandall command to execute a BDD style scenario spec in YAML.
* Focus on developers experience when creating dataflows. Where the emphasis lies in creating the events.
* Simulated "events" are read from template files. By default json is supported.
* Possibility to overwrite or extend pyrandall default behaviors with pluggy, a plugin system developed and used by pytest.
* See a complete example of pluggy: [https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#a-complete-example](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#a-complete-example)


Pyrandall is run from within docker. Connections are often only accessible through deployment and \
containers are de facto today. It also enables us to add complex dependencies like `librdkafka` to \
use confluent-kafka which supports all api versions offered by Kafka.

For adding plugins, self signed certificates etc, it is encouraged to create your own Dockerfile:

```{Dockerfile}
FROM kpnnv/pyrandall:latest

# Install your plugins
# COPY certificates etc
```

## Concepts

* A spec can consist of multiple simulate and validate steps which are executed over HTTP or Apache Kafka.
* This could be expanded to brokers in general or websockets support.
* Validate should execute assertions against the state of your application.


## Documentation

Pyrandall always could use more documentation, and help is welcome see our CONTRIBUTING.md.
At this moment code and tests are the best we have. See the `examples/` and the `test/functional`.
Also see `CHANGELOG.md` on what is fixed, changed or added.
